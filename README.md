## Overview
The goal of this project is to visualize the change over time of several hand-picked infectious diseases. They are Zika Virus, Influenza, Coronavirus, and Measles. The bulk of our data comes from the World Health Organization, Data.World, Kaggle, and a Johns Hopkins dataset that is the combined effort of multiple reputable sources. We plan to display total cases of the diseases over time with multiple manipulations including country groupings and date filters.
